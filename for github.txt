boni1000: This is working project for dealing with LLMs and performing tests, using blockchain, and databases. Can you modify all files which contains real information, i.e. real ip addresses, real private keys, etc. I want to change this information with descriptions, i.e. "your blockchain private key".

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you sanitize the sensitive information in your project files. Let me first search for files containing sensitive data like IP addresses, private keys, API keys, and other credentials. 

Searched text for `localhost|127\.0\.0\.1|192\.168\.|10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|http://\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+`, 20 results

Searched text for `private[_\s]*key|privateKey|secret[_\s]*key|api[_\s]*key|apiKey`, 14 results

Searched text for `0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40,}|sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}|AIza[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{35}`, 1 result

Searched text for `password|passwd|pwd|token|bearer`, 20 results

Let me search for more sensitive information including blockchain-related data and configuration files: 

Searched text for `infura|alchemy|web3|ethereum|blockchain`, 20 results

Searched for files matching `**/*.json`, 10 matches

Searched for files matching `**/*.env*`, no matches

Read [](file:///Users/boniradev/Downloads/Passer/src/component/configuration.json)

Let me search for more Python backend files and blockchain-related code: 

Searched text for `mongodb://|mongo_uri|MONGODB_URI|connection_string`, 12 results

Searched for files matching `**/*backEnd*.py`, 8 matches

Searched text for `PRIVATE_KEY|private_key\s*=|wallet|mnemonic`, 11 results

Let me check the blockchain-related JavaScript files: 

Read [](file:///Users/boniradev/Downloads/Passer/src/component/BCEndpoints.js)

Searched text for `5[A-Z][1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{50,}`, 20 results

Searched for files matching `**/t2img*.py`, 8 matches

Now let me create a comprehensive todo list and systematically sanitize all the files with sensitive information:
